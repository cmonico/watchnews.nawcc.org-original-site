        <div class="post_body">
          <p>For millions of young adults and children around the world Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a constant grueling battle. For decades researchers have worked tirelessly with limited funds to find a cure for this dreadful disease. Because his son was afflicted with DMD, one man has been working since 2001 to raise the funds necessary to sustain the research through several thematic auctions, known worldwide as <a href="http://www.onlywatch.com">Only Watch.</a></p>
          <p>Luc Pettavino, president of the Monaco Association against Muscular Dystrophy and founder of Only Watch, created this auction that has raised over 25 million Euros to finance fundamental and applied research in this field. This 7th edition of Only Watch is dedicated to his son, Paul Pettavino, “a beautiful soul that left us this year who gave us all the energy to make Only Watch the success it is today. The way Paul lived his life was exemplary and should reflect on all of us, as it already has through this project.”1 All proceeds from the Only Watch auction fund scientific and medical research on neuromuscular diseases in general and on DMD in particular.</p>
          <p>Only Watch, the world’s foremost biennial charity auction entirely devoted to fund the research, has caught the attention of many people over the years. His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco is just one generous person that Only Watch inspired. For the 2017 event held on November 11 in Geneva through Christie’s, the Prince has offered his patronage in hopes of contributing to the overall goal of finding a cure.</p>
          <p>The Monaco Association against Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy has been dedicating all its resources to international research since its creation in 2001. Pettavino expressed, “Today, we’re close to clinical tests. We wish we could go faster, but objectively, the progress done is beyond honorable. We keep on doing our best to go further to elaborate a treatment, and may hope continue to prevail.”2</p>
          <p>The Association Monegasque contre les Myopathies (AMM), cofounded by Luc Pettavino, has had a mission to create and consolidate the strong relationships among the international research centers with expertise in the DMD field—to turn competitors into collaborators to pursue the same cause. The Monaco round tables and the International Collaborative Effort for DMD (ICE) program were created to evaluate the advances in preclinical research on DMD and support their transition into clinical trials.</p>
          <p>The AMM finances all research through the Only Watch auction and supports the gene therapy research of Professor Robert Kotin, a world-renowned specialist in the field of gene vector production, and the International Associated Laboratory-Biotherapies applied to Neuromuscular Disabilities (LIA-BAHN), a partnership between the University of Versailles and the Monaco Scientific Centre.</p>
          <p>Held by Christie’s, the 7th edition of the charity auction will display 50 pieces, each emphasizing applied creativity in high horology. Christie’s has a global presence in 46 countries with 10 salesrooms around the world. The Only Watch tour will be held in Christie’s locations around the world, including Monaco, Bangkok, Singapore, Dubai, Istanbul, Hong Kong, Taipei, New York, Los Angeles, and Geneva. Christie’s speaks of extraordinary art, unparalleled service and expertise, and international glamour. Artists and people working the events work pro bono, such as Rahul Kadakia, the auctioneer. John Reardon, the international head of Christie’s Watch Department said, “Christie’s is honored to be part of the world of Only Watch and we look forward to welcoming you all to the various viewings around the globe and, lastly, the much anticipated auction in Geneva.”3</p>
          <p>Bringing their well-renowned brands will be some of the most prestigious houses, including Piaget, De Bethune, Speake-Marin, Konstantin Chaykin, and Agenhor Carpe Diem. Independent timepiece makers will also show off their brands while supporting this great cause.</p>
          <p>Here are a few of the watches that will be up for auction:</p>
